## Tech Stack :
This is a ReactJS based application built using NextJS. The Layout primarly consists of `Input` , `Pagination`, & `Submit` components. For demo purpose, mock name data has already been added to the App.

## Features :
1. Adding & removing friends name to the list.
2. When the list exceeds by `4` names per page, a new page is created and can be navigated throuh the `Pagination` Component provided below.
3. There is an option to `star` any of the names from the list. Once a name is starred, it will be **auto-pinned** at the very top of the list (starting from the 1st page)
